Blockchain and AI-Based Fraud Call Detection System

Overview
This project integrates Blockchain Technology and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to create a system that detects fraudulent calls in call center operations. By combining the transparency and immutability of blockchain with the predictive power of AI, this solution offers a robust and efficient approach to fraud detection.

Key Features
AI-Powered Fraud Detection: A deep learning model trained to classify calls as fraudulent or non-fraudulent.
Blockchain Integration: Secure storage of fraud detection results in a tamper-proof blockchain ledger.
Data Visualization: Comprehensive visual insights including heatmaps, scatter plots, and performance metrics.
User-Friendly: Built for seamless execution in Google Colab with minimal setup required.
How It Works
Step 1: Data Preprocessing
Cleans and prepares call dataset for analysis.
Derives additional metrics like Abandonment Rate and Average Handling Time.
Step 2: Fraud Detection Model
Implements a deep learning neural network to classify call records.
Outputs evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Step 3: Blockchain Integration
Stores detection results in a blockchain where each block contains fraud records.
Uses cryptographic hashing for immutability and validation.
Step 4: Result Visualization
Generates heatmaps, scatter plots, and other graphs to interpret the findings.
Confusion matrices and training metrics provide additional clarity.
